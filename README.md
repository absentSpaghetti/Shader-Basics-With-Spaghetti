# Shader-Basics-With-Spaghetti
Starting from basic shaders, arriving at more complex ones

## What and why?
This repository contains a collection of shaders for the Godot game engine. I created this repo because I am interested in shaders, want to learn them and share that experience with other game develoeprs. This repo is tutorialised, meaning that each shader contains comments explaining how I understand it (which may lead to me being wrong) and what certain parts are supposed to do

## Who is this for?
This repository is for anyone who wants to learn about writing shaders with me, but doesn't know where to start

## How to use it?
Shaders are stored in the `/shaders` folder. This folder is split into `post-processing` and `object` folders, which themselves have two folders each, `/3D` and `/2D`. The names are self-explanatory.
Scenes are stored in the `/scenes` folder
