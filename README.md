# Shader-Basics-With-Spaghetti
Starting from basic shaders, arriving at more complex ones

## What and why?
This repository contains a collection of shaders for the Godot game engine. I created this repo because I am interested in shaders and I feel like there is not enough information online about them. This repo is heavily tutorialised, meaning that each shader contains comments explaining what does what and how.

## How to use?
Shaders are stored in the `/shaders` folder, which itself has two folder `/3D` and `/2D`. The names are self-explanatory.
Scenes are stored in the `/scenes` folder
