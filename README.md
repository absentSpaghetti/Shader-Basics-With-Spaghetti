# Shader-Basics-With-Spaghetti
Starting from basic shaders, arriving at more complex ones

## What and why?
This repository contains a collection of shaders for the Godot game engine. I created this repo because I am interested in shaders, want to learn them and share that experience with other game develoeprs. This repo is tutorialised, meaning that each shader contains comments explaining the shader, what does what and how.

## How to use?
Shaders are stored in the `/shaders` folder. This folder is split into `post-processing` and `object` folders, which themselves have two folders each, `/3D` and `/2D`. The names are self-explanatory.
Scenes are stored in the `/scenes` folder
